              <h3 class="text-secondary">Freshman Year, Part 2</h3>
              <br>
              <p>A few months later, around December, I decided to get back into the saddle. I was ambitious and had
                high expectations for myself, so I was willing to give it another go. I took <b>
                  Baology&rsquo;s Winter
                  Booster class
                </b> curing winter break, and I wholly 110% endorse it.</p>
              <p>Compared to the once-a-week pace of the
                main class (at the time there were only two TA sessions),<em>
                  solving past exams once a day and being in a
                  community where everyone was wholly focused on USABO
                </em> was truly inspiring.</p>
              <p><em>My original goals for freshman year were to hopefully make semis.</em> Fortunately, it was 2020 so
                I had
                online school and a lot of free time to devote towards reading. I wasn&rsquo;t (and still am not) a very
                fast reader, so I read around 2 hours a day and vowed to <b>
                  maintain a pace of 1 chapter a day to finish
                  Campbell by Opens.
                </b></p>

              <div style="text-align: center;">
                <span class="blog-bubble section-bubble coming-soon">
                  <i class="bi bi-book"></i>
                  <span>Read more about <b>reading stamina</b> and <b>study pace</b> <em>(coming soon)</em></span>
                </span>
              </div>
              <br>
              <br>

              <p>By the time Opens rolled around I had read about <b>80% of Campbell</b>, but I had taken many past open
                exams
                as preparation and I had been scoring above the cutoff by 1-5 pts so I felt cautiously optimistic that I
                would make semis. When I qualified I was overjoyed and even considered taking a break. Just making semis
                was good enough for me at the time, and I figured there was no chance I would get any further in USABO.
              </p>

              <p><em>I ended up deciding to study a little bit before semis just so that I wouldn&rsquo;t be completely
                  unprepared</em> (the style and content are completely different). I figured it would at least give me
                a
                headstart when I tried again next year.</p>
              <div style="text-align: center;">

              <br>
              <br>

              <p>After semis, I was totally relaxed. It was the end of the 2021 USABO &ldquo;season&rdquo; and I figured
                I could rest and look towards next year. <b class="text-primary">
                  I was totally not expecting to receive a cryptic &ldquo;camp
                  email&rdquo; a few weeks later.
                </b></p>
              <p><b>
                  I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have many happy moments in my life, but to this day, I still think
                  that
                  moment when I found out I made camp for the first time was the happiest I&rsquo;ve ever been.
                </b> It was
                just so unexpected and it was the first and only time I&rsquo;ve ever actually cried tears of joy.</p>
              <p> <em>I truly hope that all of you reading this can one day make camp too and have that feeling
                  too.</em></p>
              <p>I think my freshman year was my most &ldquo;canonical USABO Journey&rdquo;, and it was an extremely
                personally meaningful period in my life. I&rsquo;ve rambled a lot (and unfortunately for you I will
                continue to ramble in future posts) but <em>
                  I honestly hope that this series can be helpful or at least
                  inspirational to someone in my shoes.
                </em> I know this is extremely cliche, but you should take it especially
                coming from me:</p>
              <h4 style="text-align: center;"><b class="text-secondary">Just believing in yourself is the most important
                  part of your USABO
                  journey.</b></h4>
              <br>

              <div class="callout-box callout-center callout-wide">

                </div>
                <p>As an aside, my school actually never had anyone take USABO before, and so I couldn&rsquo;t find a
                  school proctor. I ended up taking it with Kevin under UW Madison, which is why if you look back at the
                  2021 USABO finalists you&rsquo;ll see some &ldquo;mystery finalist&rdquo; who was a &ldquo;college
                  student&rdquo;. Because people didn&rsquo;t know who I was, this caused quite a stir in BODS and was
                  quite funny for Baology.</p>
