              <h3 class="text-secondary">Early Years</h3>
              <br>

              <p>I suppose the most appropriate place to start is <b class="text-secondary">how I even learned about the
                  USABO.</b></p>
              <p>I&rsquo;d always shown a lot of interest in STEM as a child, reading tons of science books from the
                library every week, and my parents had lofty dreams for both me and my older brother. In middle school,
                they encouraged him to compete in Math competitions like Mathcounts and AMC8/10, and seeing as he was
                pretty good, then later me as well. </p>

              <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was terrible, <em class="text-secondary">but I just didn&rsquo;t find
                  competition math that interesting at the time.</em><b class="text-secondary"> My true love had always
                  been biology.</b></p>
              <p>As a child, I watched a lot of nature documentaries, and to this day, I still credit them with sparking
                my love for biology and evolution. I remember back in 3rd grade, I stumbled upon <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF"><u>Hank Green&rsquo;s Crash Course
                    Biology</u></a> and watched the whole series out of curiosity.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I probably didn&rsquo;t understand like 80% of the content at the time, <em
                  class="text-secondary">but it cemented my love for bio at a young age.&nbsp;</em></p>
              <br>

              <h3 class="text-secondary">Freshman Year, Part 1</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Fast forward a few years and I first heard about USABO through Science Olympiad in 8th grade.
                Originally under the naive impression (of parents in my area) that the road to a good school like MIT
                was only through math competitions, <em class="text-secondary">it was exciting to think that there was
                  my own path, that all my interest in Bio wasn&rsquo;t just a curiosity anymore.</em> I set my goals
                very high, hoping to make camp by my Junior year, and I started studying the summer before 9th grade.
              </p>
              <p><b class="text-secondary">To current highschoolers, I&rsquo;d say not to worry.</b> While I&rsquo;ve
                heard some students nowadays start studying as early as middle school, I think my starting point was
                neither particularly early nor too late. <em class="text-secondary">And while there is a lot of content
                  in USABO, I think studying for 1-2 years is sufficient.</em></p>

              <div style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="recommended-textbooks.html" class="blog-bubble">

              <br>
              <br>

              <p>In 2020, I took the inaugural class of Baology, Season 1 Session 1. As (basically) a middle schooler,
                <em class="text-secondary">it was honestly pretty intimidating at first.&nbsp;</em>

              <!-- conver the below to a list format -->

              <!-- These ordered lists should be formatted more nicely -- have a colored circle and number in the center -->
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Like most kids, I had never actually read a textbook from cover to cover before.</b> I
                    didn&rsquo;t have any study strategies and the sheer volume of content was scary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><b>The competition structure of USABO seemed daunting at first.</b> Coming from the world of
                    competition math, where cutoffs are somewhat more lenient and there&rsquo;s ample chance to prove
                    oneself, the seemingly massive canyon between 1000 semifinalists and only 20 finalists was
                    discouraging.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>To those of you from competitive regions like California, NoVa, Texas, or New York, I&rsquo;m
                        sure there&rsquo;s talk about campers in various olympiads from your area every year. But I was
                        from a less competitive area where even USAMO was a huge accomplishment that the WeChat moms
                        would talk about for years, and we&rsquo;d practically never heard of someone
                        &ldquo;camping&rdquo;.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Whereas AMC had many tiers (AMC&rarr;AIME&rarr;USAMO&rarr;MOP) with hundreds of qualifiers even
                        at higher levels, the sharp cutoff of USABO left me worried that I could never progress beyond
                        semis.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br>

              <p>This seemingly massive hurdle was something that truly weighed on me for many months. Granted, this was
                only because <em>I had set my goals so high from the start.</em></p>
              <p>I started off with eager passion and curiosity, but even halfway through the course, I started finding
                the material too hard. <b>This was definitely a &ldquo;skill issue&rdquo; on my part, though.</b></p>
              <p>The original version of the course only had one level for all students, both beginners and more
                advanced students. <em>Now that there&rsquo;s two levels, I think this is one of the biggest
                  improvements in the course,</em> smoothing out the learning curve for students who are just starting
                off and need the guidance most.</p>

                <p>Feel free to ask the original staff (Kevin, Joseph) for stories, but there are many memes about how I
                  always thought I was &ldquo;actually so bad though.&rdquo; I was &ldquo;so bad&rdquo; that I
                  &ldquo;gave up&rdquo;, and decided to not take Session 2. In retrospect, this was obviously a mistake,
                  but this takes me to my first piece of advice:</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                  <span class="blog-bubble section-bubble coming-soon">
                    <i class="bi bi-mask"></i>

                  </span>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p><b>USABO is a marathon, not a sprint.</b> I always says this and it could not be more true. Coming from
                a competition math background, where skills and problem-solving may come intuitively to the gifted,
                there
                is a lot less of that in USABO. Practically <em>everyone</em> comes in without any knowledge, and
                <em>everyone</em> starts as a noob.
              </p>
              <p>Studying for USABO wasn&rsquo;t as easy as I thought <em>(you&rsquo;re telling me
                  I get to study the subject I actually like and I can just read my way into MIT?)</em> I put my USABO
                journey on hold
                (maybe indefinitely), and I honestly think I just rotted for my first semester of 9th grade.</p>
