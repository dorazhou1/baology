        <p class="wow fadeInLeft text-center" data-wow-delay=".3s" data-wow-duration=".8s"><strong class="text-primary-dark">The Baology Prep Course is designed to be the Biology Olympiad course that our instructors wished they had access to when they were students. All of our instructors are not only alumni of the Biology Olympiad programs, but also competed at the top levels in them. While this course is designed for students of all levels including beginners, many find the content most easily absorbed if they do the assigned readings for each class prior the lecture. Our goal is to take the official textbook of USABO, Campbell Biology, and use it as a framework to build more advanced topics. As such our class will benefit students both introductory and advanced. We pride ourselves on three principles when teaching our course:</strong></p>
        
        <ol class="steps text-primary-dark">
            <li><div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".1s"><strong class="text-secondary font-secondary text-lg">Content:</strong><p class="text-md text-primary-dark" style="line-height: normal;"> Whenever possible we strive to cover more and not less material. We will often hold additional sessions, review classes, and even community activities for students of the course</p></div></li>
            <li><div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".1s"><strong class="text-secondary font-secondary text-lg">Community:</strong><p class="text-md text-primary-dark" style="line-height: normal;"> We think that with any competition as intensive and involved as USABO, half the battle is finding the motivation to study. By fostering a community of fellow biology enthusiasts we find that students find studying no longer a chore but a fun challenge to undertake</p></div></li>
            <li><div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".1s"><strong class="text-secondary font-secondary text-lg">Cognizance:</strong><p class="text-md text-primary-dark" style="line-height: normal;"> Study smarter not harder is a common adage, and we strive to bring the “smart” to the table. As former high-performers ourselves, we know the stress of dealing with other extracurriculars, challenging classes, and a social life, so we try to focus a big part of the class on strategy and skills so even if you don’t have time to master all the content you can see improvements to your performance.</p></div></li>
